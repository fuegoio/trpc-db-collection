# tRPC Tanstack DB collection

This package makes it easy to integrate a tRPC router with a Tanstack DB collection, allowing for simple data management on the front-end as well as real-time synchronization between clients easily. Contrary to solutions like ElectricSQL, this gives you full ownership and control over the backend for both read and writes, as well as full typing thanks to tRPC powerful inference system.
